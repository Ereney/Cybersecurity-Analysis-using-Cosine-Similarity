# Cybersecurity Analysis using Cosine Similarity
*What is Cosine similarity:* <br>
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity in direction between two vectors, ignoring their size (or magnitude).<br>
Consider two arrows (vectors) starting from the same point, then;<br>
-	If the arrows point in the exact same direction, their cosine similarity is 1.
-	If the arrows are perpendicular (forming a 90-degree angle), their cosine similarity is 0. This means they are "unrelated" in direction.
-	If the arrows point in opposite directions, their cosine similarity is -1.
## Mathematics of Cosine Similarity
It is calculated by finding the cosine of the angle $\theta$  between the two vectors $A$ and $B$:<br>
$$\cos(\theta)=\frac{A\cdot B}{|A||B|}$$<br>
Where;<br>
- ${A\cdot B}$ is the dot product of the vectors (a measure of how much one vector "goes along" with the other).
- $|A|$ and $|B|$  are the magnitudes (or lengths) of the vectors.
## Application of Cosine Similarity on Cybersecurity
Assuming there are two vectors, v_1 and v_2. Where v_1 is the vector pattern of admin trying to login while v_2 is the pattern of any other person trying to login. Calculating the cosine of the angle between the two vectors will tell us if the second person trying to login is admin or not if the cosine similarity is close to 1.
### Example
A cybersecurity system monitors network behavior using 5-dimensional activity vectors for each user session:<br>
$activity vector=[â–ˆ(DataTransferGB,LoginAttempts,PrivilageRequests,NetworkScans,FailedAuthentications)]$<br>
Considering the below baseline patterns;
- Normal User: n = [0.8,3,1,0,0]
- Admin User: a=[2.1,8,5,2,1]
- Suspicious Activity 1: s_1=[15.2,25,12,8,15]
- Suspicious Activity 2: s_2=[1.2,45,3,15,32]
- Current Session: c=[3.4,12,7,3,4]
