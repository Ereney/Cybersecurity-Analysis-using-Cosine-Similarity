# Cybersecurity Analysis using Cosine Similarity
*What is Cosine similarity:* <br>
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity in direction between two vectors, ignoring their size (or magnitude).<br>
Consider two arrows (vectors) starting from the same point, then;<br>
-	If the arrows point in the exact same direction, their cosine similarity is 1.
-	If the arrows are perpendicular (forming a 90-degree angle), their cosine similarity is 0. This means they are "unrelated" in direction.
-	If the arrows point in opposite directions, their cosine similarity is -1.
## Mathematics of Cosine Similarity
It is calculated by finding the cosine of the angle Î¸  between the two vectors A and B:
